# More Or Less Design System — Guidelines

## Components

The design system exports these components — import them from `@/design-system/more-or-less-design-system-8cbfc8` and compose them before building anything from scratch:

`AnswerButton`, `Badge`, `Button`, `CardLabel`, `CardTitle`, `Card`, `CodeInput`, `LeaderboardRow`, `NavBar`, `ProgressBar`, `ResultBanner`, `ShotClock`, `StatValue`, `TabBar`, `TierRow`, `TopicTile`

Per-component details (import stanzas, props, variants, examples) live in `.lovable/rules/libraries/more-or-less-design-system-8cbfc8/components.md` — on disk, not auto-loaded. Read that file or the component source when the name alone isn't enough.

## Theme Files

The design system's theme is delivered through the following files. The author's original source files carry the full wiring the design system needs — variable declarations, framework-specific directives, provider objects, etc. — and are the canonical import target.

- `@ws-379cae16210c2fefdfa6/8806c3d0-8207-4d84-8d42-4534b6b552ef/design-system/more-or-less-admin-site-72d612/design-system/theme/tokens.css` (source — preferred import)
- `@ws-379cae16210c2fefdfa6/8806c3d0-8207-4d84-8d42-4534b6b552ef/styles.css` (source — preferred import)
- `@ws-379cae16210c2fefdfa6/8806c3d0-8207-4d84-8d42-4534b6b552ef/dist/tokens.css` (auto-generated flat list of CSS custom properties — a raw-values fallback only; does NOT carry framework-specific wiring that the source files above provide)
